XKCD-Reader-2.0
===============
New,better version, more MVC'ish

After getting XKCD Reader working, hackishly, I wanted to start over and "do it right", this project is the new version.

Designed to be MVC:

Brains - model, responsible for loading data from the web

LICENSE:

No license, this is a proof of concept, not sure at this point what will become of this project.  Might be open sourced, might be proprietary, just not sure ...
